/* Make a program that reads three double-precision floating-point values: A, B, and C. Then calculates and show:
   a) the area of the right-angled triangle that has A for base and C for height.
   b) the area of the circle of radius C. (pi = 3.14159)
   c) the area of the trapezoid that has A and B for bases and C for height.
   d) the area of the square that has side B.
   e) the area of the rectangle that has sides A and B. */
